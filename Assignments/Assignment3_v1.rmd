## Regular Expressions

### 1
```{Q1}
Find what: \s{3}
Replace with: ,\s{1}
Explanation: For every 3 spaces, I replaced it with a comma and 1 space.
```
### 2
```{Q2}
Find what: (\w+)\, (\w+)\s.* (\w.*)
Replace with: \2 \1 \3
Explanation: I first focused on capturing the elements I wanted to keep (the first & last name, and the email
address). I then excluded everything after the second name using the "everything else (.*)" expression as some
students don't have a middle intial. I also used .* to capture the whole email. 

```
### 3
```{Q1}
Find what: (\w.*)\,.*(\,.*)
Replace with: - \1_\2
Explanation: I captured the common name, excluded the genus species name with \,., and then included the comma
after species and the number.
```
### 4
```{Q1}
Find what: (\w.*), (\w{1})\w+ (\w.*)
Replace with: - \1, \2_\3
Explanation: I captured the common name (\w.*), the first letter of the genus (\w{1}), and the species name and number with (\w.*). I then used replace to add in ", and _".
```
