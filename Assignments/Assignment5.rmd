#### Assignment 5

## load the packages needed: 
```
require(tidyverse)
```

## Download and import data
```
Part1 <- read_csv("https://github.com/mbtoomey/Biol_7263/blob/main/Data/assignment6part1.csv?raw=true")
Part2 <- read_csv("https://github.com/mbtoomey/Biol_7263/blob/main/Data/assignment6part2.csv?raw=true")
View(Part1) # body_length, age
View(Part2) # mass

```
## Pivot-long
```
#seperate out subject column into 3 cols
p1_1 <- Part1 %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = !ID, names_to = c("Subject", "Sex", "Treatment"), names_sep= "_")
View(p1_1)

#change ID col, into 2
p1_2 <- p1_1 %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = ID, values_from = value)
View(p1_2)

p2_1 <- Part2 %>%
  pivot_longer(col=!ID, names_to = c("Subject"),
                        names_pattern = "(Sample1?.)..*")
View(p2_1)  #id, subject, value

#now join for mass
p2_2 <- p2_1 %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = ID, values_from = value)
View(p2_2)

```

## Join Parts together to make a whole
```
#export as .csv in folder called Results
write_csv(p1_2 %>%
  inner_join(p2_2, by = "Subject"),
  "Results/Assn5_Whole.csv")
  
```

## Problem 2

```


#New tibble w/ mean +/- standard deviation of the residual mass (mass/body length) 
#   by treatment and sex - group-by?
#export as a .csv file to “Results” folder within your R projec

#add in our tibble
Whole <- read_csv("Results/Assn5_Whole.csv")
View(Whole)
#mean and st.dev for residual mass (mass/body length)
Whole_T <- Whole %>%
  group_by(Treatment) %>%
  mutate(resid_mass = mass / body_length) %>%
  summarize(mean_resid_mass = mean(resid_mass),
            SD_resid_mass = sd(resid_mass))
View(Whole_T)  

```
## Wrapping it up
```
Whole_S <- Whole %>%
  group_by(Sex) %>%
  mutate(resid_mass = mass / body_length) %>%
  summarize(mean_resid_mass = mean(resid_mass),
            SD_resid_mass = sd(resid_mass))
View(Whole_S)

#Now we need to combine T and S tibbles
write_csv(Whole_T %>%
            full_join(Whole_S), "Results/Assign5_Whole_Complete.csv")

```
