## Read in file

MBT_ebird <- read.csv("https://github.com/mbtoomey/Biol_7263/blob/main/Data/MBT_ebird.csv?raw=true") #read in my ebird csv file from github account

## Problem 2
## Which year has the most individual birds, how many?

# group by year, the summarize count for each year?
# Now, group by year, and create col of year counts
MBT_COUNT <- MBT_ebird %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(year_count = n())
#Check year count worked
View(MBT_COUNT)
#    good2go

#output max value w/in year count
maxcount <- max(MBT_COUNT$year_count)
#tibble with only values from the year with most counts
maxyear <- filter(MBT_COUNT, year_count == maxcount)
View(maxyear)
 
#print answers out
# 2014

## Problem 2
## in that year (2014), how many different species did I observe?
#count all unique instance of name
species_count <- n_distinct(maxyear$scientific_name)
species_count

#print answer
# In 2014, 210 unique species were observed. 

## Problem 3
## Which state, most freq. observe red-winged blackbirds?

#use search to find pattern of red-winged blackbirds
#create new tibble with only those matches
rwb_count <- filter(MBT_ebird, common_name == "Red-winged Blackbird")
View(rwb_count)

#group by state, create count var

  group_by(location) %>%
  mutate(location_count = n())
View(state_rwb_count)

#remove unique location counts
unique(rwb_count$location_count)
summarize(state_rwb_count = sum(location_count))  #sum total counts
?unique
#print resutlsyear has the most individual birds, how many?
#sum count based on location?

## Problem 4
## Filter 5-200min duration. 
# Find mean rate per checklist that I encounter species each year
# calculate number of species in each checklist / duration - take mean for year
duration_5t200min <- MBT_ebird %>%
  filter(duration >= 5 & duration <= 200) %>%
  group_by(list_ID) %>%
  
#NUM SPECIES IN each list_ID / duration of list
# mean of rate per checklist
View(duration_5t200min)

## Problem 5
## tibble w/10 top freq.obsv.species. 
# make a top ten list _ sort by observations, then remove unique species ,  head of ten
# filter observations with that list
# export tibble to csv in folder 'Results' w/in R project
# add link to markdown doc.











#select all species names and put in list
species_count <- maxyear %>%
  group_by(scientific_name) %>%
  mutate(scientific_name_count = n())

View(species_count)
#find max value
maxcountspecies <- max(species_count$scientific_name_count)
